# What is a type system

Syntax features -> Design Patterns

Syntax features

- what is an interface?
- what is the syntax for defining an interface

Design patterns

- How do we use interfaces to write reusable code?

Type - Easy way to refer to the different properties and functions that a value has
A value is anything we can assign to a variable

"red" ---> it is a string
---> it is a value that has all the properties and methods that a string has indexOf, substring etc.

      A value that we create has a type associated with it

      An inteface is a shortcut to annonate all the properites and methods associated with the value

Examples of Types
string, number, boolean, Date, Object

In the worlds of type script we have two sets of types

1. Primitive Types -> number, boolean, void, undefined, string, symbol, null
2. Object Types -> functions, arrays, classes, objects
